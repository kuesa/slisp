# Stupid Lisp (SLISP)
This is Stupid Lisp, or SLISP, a fork of ANSI Common Lisp (CLISP). It's primary (and only) difference is that it returns 21 when 9 and 10 are added.

## Getting Started
The lovel developers of CLISP have included very awesome installation instructions inside `INSTALL`. You can also check out `unix/INSTALL`, which is
by far the easiest way to get it up and running.

## What's 9 + 10?
21.
